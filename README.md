# Sudoku-Android-

About: This was a final project for a CSU Java class where I created a Sudoku app using a walkthrough from an Android Developer Textbook (I cannot remember the name, but if I find the textbook I'll update this readme).  This app was originally created in eclipse IDE with the android apk package in 2014.  Even though I didn't do so hot on the final test in the class that year, I did receive full credit for this final project!

To Run:  There are two options for running this. 

1. The way I recommend running this is using the BlueStacks player that can be downloaded for free at http://www.bluestacks.com/download.html. Go ahead and link it to your Google + account (just like any other Android tablet), and just turn off all the checkmarked options (ignore the hardware acceleration stuff).  Getting to the homepage is the hardest part. From there you should have a view similar to what I have in the I included screenshot HowToOpenAPKBluestacks.jpg with the apk pointed out in the left side of the screen.  Go ahead and click on that button and navigate to the the path Sudoku!!!!!->bin where you will find a file called Sudoku!!!!!.apk and install it and then run it! I hope I added enough scary color and blood and gore themes to make your sudoku experience all the more enjoyable!


2. If you are an Android developer with the eclipse/android setup, you can simply add this repository to your project folder and run the emulator within Eclipse.  However, I do not recommend this because I ran into emulation problems due to a glitch where the emulator only uses one of your computer's processor's cores and was incredibly slow.
